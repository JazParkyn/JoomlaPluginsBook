JoomlaPluginsBook
=================

This repository contains code samples as used in the book "Programming Joomla! Plugins"
written by Jisse Reitsma (2014). More information on this book is available here:
https://www.yireo.com/books/programming-joomla-plugins-book

The code samples are divided into separate chapters, each chapter containing a source tree
of the plugins discussed in that chapter. The layout of such a source tree might look like this:

    plugins/system/example/example.php
    plugins/system/example/example.xml
    administrator/language/en-GB/en-GB.plg_system_example.ini
    administrator/language/en-GB/en-GB.plg_system_example.sys.ini

The samples can be installed in Joomla! by copying all relevant files to a Joomla! site
and using the "Discover" feauture of the Joomla! Extension Manager to install things.
